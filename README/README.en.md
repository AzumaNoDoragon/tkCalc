# tkCalc

**Development of a calculator with a graphical interface similar to the standard Windows calculator.**

This project uses **Tkinter** to create the graphical interface and **Pillow** for manipulating graphic elements. The calculator allows the input of numbers and operators, performs calculations, and manipulates signs and inputs.
